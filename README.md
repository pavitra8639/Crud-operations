# Crud-operations
CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, Delete—are the foundation of dynamic web apps. In eCommerce, they manage products, users, and orders: adding new items, viewing listings, editing details, and removing data. CRUD enables seamless interaction between frontend and backend using databases and APIs.
